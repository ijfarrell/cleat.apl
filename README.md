# cleat.apl~
cleat.apl~ (CLEAT Acoustic Point Localizer) is a max object for placing point sources of audio on sparse multichannel speaker grids.

Designed for the CLEAT system (Elastic Arts, Chicago, IL), a 16ch 4x4 grid of ceiling mounted hemishperical point source speakers spaced 2.83 m apart in x-y. 

This object allows for acoustically informed spatialization of monophonic of monophonic input signals onto, and above, the speaker array. This is done with pseudo-wave-field-synthesis techniques to map group delay and air absorbtion across the space. Parameters are left exposed to the user to exploit these spatial and acoustical characteristics for artistic purpose.
