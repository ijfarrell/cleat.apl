# cleat.apl
cleat.apl~ (CLEAT Acoustic Point Localizer) is a max object for placing point sources of audio on sparse multichannel speaker grids.

Designed for the CLEAT system (Elastic Arts, Chicago, IL), a 16ch 4x4 grid of ceiling mounted hemisperical point source speakers spaced 2.83m apart in x-y. 

This object allows for acoustically informed spatialization of monophonic of monophonic input signals onto, and above, the speaker array. This is done with pseudo-wave-field-synthesis techniques to map group delay and air absorbtion across the space. Parameters are left exposed to the user to exploit these spatial and acoustical characteristics for artistic purpose.

This object was inspired in part by Damon Ammons' CLEAT Mixing Software: github.com/nisipulsewidth/CleatMixingSoftware
